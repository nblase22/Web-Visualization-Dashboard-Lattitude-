# Web-Visualization-Dashboard-Lattitude-

Created a dashboard using Bootstrap to demonstrate the results of the Weatherpy repository.

Created individual pages for each plot and a means by which a user can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Includes a  landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
